Games or small interesting demos of things that I've worked on in my spare time.

Tetris.
A small Tetris clone written in C++ and SDL 

Platformer.
A WIP platformer to try out different tricks and techniques - Note that this is not the current working version, I am having some problems recovering the latest version after a windows 10 insider build failed and caused me to lose information on a particular drive

JPS
A Jump-Point-Search Implementation.

OGL
A small example of some open-gl tutorials that I've followed and fiddled with.
